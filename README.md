## What is this?
This project focuses on creating a decentralized timeline, taking advantage of peer-to-peer and edge devices. This service allows users to subscribe others and, as they check others posts, they also help with post persistence. Nevertheless, there is a bootstrap server that helps to discover IPs online on the overlay network.
